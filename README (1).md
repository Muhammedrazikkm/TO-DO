# TO-DO

This React project creates a simple to-do list application. Users can add tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks from the list. The tasks are stored locally using the browser's localStorage API and persist even after the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.
Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

* Users can input tasks into an input field and add them to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button.

* Existing tasks are displayed as a list, each with an "Edit" and a "Delete" button.
* Clicking the "Edit" button allows users to edit the content of a task inline within the input field. After editing, users can click "Update Task" to save the changes.
* Clicking the "Delete" button removes the corresponding task from the list.
The application is suitable for individuals who need a simple to-do list manager for personal use, such as keeping track of tasks, goals, or reminders.
